Description: Provides a framework for integrating Large Language 
    Models (LLMs) with R programming through workflow automation. 
    Built on the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) architecture, enables 
    bi-directional communication between LLMs and R environments. 
    Features include automated code generation and execution, intelligent 
    error handling with retry mechanisms, persistent session management, 
    structured JSON output validation, and context-aware conversation management.
